# Chevron

Chevron aims to be a 'simple set of useful tools'. This means that it
exists as a humble collection of code I've written and found quite useful.
Over time I hope it grows in scope and usefulness but not in complexity.

# Why?

Because I find these tools useful and wanted to package them in a way
that I could reuse them. Most of these tools have made building web
applications much easier for me.

# Usage

Look at each module individually for tests, examples, etc.

# Installation

Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) `"require" : { "henderjon/chevron": "1.*" }`

# License

Each module carries its own LICENSE.md. A [BSD-3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license.
