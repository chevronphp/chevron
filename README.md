# chevron/chevron

Chevron aims to be a 'simple set of useful tools'. This means that it
exists as a humble collection of code I've written and found quite useful.
Over time I hope it grows in scope and usefulness but not in complexity.

# Why?

Because I find these tools useful and wanted to package them in a way
that I could reuse them. Most of these tools have made building web
applications much easier for me.

See [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/chevron/chevron) for version/installation info. At the moment, I recommend using `"chevron/chevron":"~2.0"`.
