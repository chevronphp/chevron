# Chevron

Chevron aims to be a 'simple set of useful tools'. This means that it
exists as a humble collection of code I've written and found quite useful.
Over time I hope it grows in scope and usefulness but not in complexity.

# Why?

Because I find these tools useful and wanted to package them in a way
that I could reuse them. Most of these tools have made building web
applications much easier for me.

# Usage

You're best bet is to check the tests to see usage, as I'm awful at
documentation.

# Installation

Install the [Packagist archive](https://packagist.org/packages/henderjon/chevron)
using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

```require: "henderjon/chevron": "v0.2.*"```

# Versions

I will *generally* respect [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
